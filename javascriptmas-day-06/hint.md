One way to do this could be to shuffle the array first, then use a "circular
assignment" method, where the first person in the array gets the second, the
second gets the third, etc. and the last person gets the first.

Feel free to use ChatGPT or Google to help you learn how to shuffle an array,
or stretch yourself to come up with a way on your own!
