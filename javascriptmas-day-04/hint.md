游꾸 The OpenAI API is the easiest API for this challenge but you can also try with HugginfFace.

游꾸 For OpenAI you will need to use the chat completions endpoint, which you can read about in the docs here:

游꾸 For HuggingFace, I would recommend using the "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" model. Check out these docs to get you going:
