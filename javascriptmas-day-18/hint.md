🎁 You can use OpenAI or HuggingFace to complete the AI section of this challenge.

🎁 For OpenAI, you'll probably want to investigate "GPT-4 with Vision". Check out the docs:

🎁 For HuggingFace, I used the "Salesforce/blip-image-captioning-base" model with the "imageToText" endpoint, although that is not the only way. You can read about that in the docs here:
